# Nominatim Location Picker 
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/pub-0.0.1-orange)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)


Nominatim Location Picker is a package that appears as a free alternative with support for Geocoding, using the OpenStreetMap API Using the OpenStreetMap API serving as a substitute for Google Maps and MapBox spatial search. However, there are some limitations regarding its use on a large scale project.
  

# Using the OpenStreetMap API Location Picker's version 0.0.1 new features!
----------------------
 - Geocoding search
 - Get Current User Location
 - Returns the Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the searched location 
 - Returns the description of the searched location
 - Returns the Country, State, city and district of the searched Location


 # OpenStreetMap Nominatim
----------------------

Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OpenStreetMap data
by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of
OSM points (reverse geocoding). An instance with up-to-date data can be found
at https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org. Nominatim is also used as one of the
sources for the Search box on the OpenStreetMap home page.

# Nominatim's Documentation
------------

The documentation of the latest development version is in the
`docs/` subdirectory. A HTML version can be found at
https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/ .

# Nominatim's Limitations

- No heavy uses (an absolute maximum of 1 request per second).
- Provide a valid HTTP Referer or User-Agent identifying the application (stock User-Agents as set by http libraries will not do).
- Clearly display attribution as suitable for your medium.
- Data is provided under the ODbL license which requires to share alike (although small extractions are likely to be covered by fair usage / fair dealing).

## Usage
-----------
To use this plugin, add `nominatim_location_picker` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

```dart
nominatim_location_picker ^0.0.1
```

Import the Nominatim Location Picker in your .dart file...

```dart
import 'package:nominatim_location_picker/nominatim_location_picker.dart';
```

### Android Permissions 
-----------
The following permissions are recommended.

`android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` Allows the API to determine as precise a location as possible from the available location providers, including the Global Positioning System (GPS) as well as WiFi and mobile cell data.

`android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` Allows the API to use WiFi or mobile cell data (or both) to determine the device's location. The API returns the location with an accuracy approximately equivalent to a city block.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
